# FACE-RECOGNITION
PROJECT FOR FACE RECOGNITION

Face Recognition Using Image Processing is a project I've created.





To create this project, I used the following resources:



1) Python, for starters (V3)

2) OpenCV (Computer Vision)

3) Internet Cam



There are three elements to this project:



1) Obtaining data sets

2) Data set for training

2) Detection or examination



The purpose of this project is to find and detect human faces in a colour photograph.



A series of seven practise photos was made available.

for this purpose. The goal was to create and build a MATLAB face detector that can detect human faces in a picture.

to the photographs for training

One of the simplest ways to tell who someone is is by looking at their face.

Face recognition is a method of identifying a person.

A strategy that capitalises on a person's unique characteristics.
